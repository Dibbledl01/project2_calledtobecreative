BIG PICTURE - BRONZE, SILVER, and GOLD PLAN
As a user, I want to utilize the website Called To Be Creative to search for upcoming conferences and workshops in my region that align with my professional development interests.

As an administrator, I want to approve new conferences and workshops (both submitted to the website through users and not) before they are posted so that I can make sure they are real and relevant.

BRONZE PLAN and SILVER PLAN
As a user, I first want to navigate to a homepage that is inspiration and yet informative. The landing page should convey the name of the website, as well as the fact that it is intended to inform me of the best upcoming workshops and conferences that fit my professional interests as a creative entrepreneur (photographer, event planner, florist, etc.)

As a user, I want to see images and one-liners (on the homepage) with regards to the three most recent upcoming workshops.

As a user, I want to navigate to the "conferences" portion of the website that first breaks down conferences by "region:" Northeast, South, Midwest, Northwest.
  As a user, I want the option to choose which region best describes my location of business/workshop and conferemce location preference.

As a user, I want to scroll down the page and view the title, category, duration, cost, brief description, and corresponding image of upcoming conferences and workshops in my chosen region.
  Each workshop should include a link to that conference or workshop's homepage.

As a user, I  want to navigate to a portion of the website that permits me to complete a form containing information regarding a workshop or conference I am hosting that is not already featured on the website.
  The information input from this form would be sent to an Administrator for review and approval/disapproval.

GOLD PLAN
As a user, I want to be able to login to the website.
  As a user, I want to be able to create a profile that will contain brief information about me, my business, and whether or not I will be attending any listed upcoming conferences.
    As a user, I want to be able to search for and connect with other creative entrepreneurs attending conferences and workshops.
